# "New Blog" -- 06/20/2022

A personal site is something that I've been meaning to put together for a while now but never got around to actually making. I've been working on a generic "Top Down Shooter" in C++ from scratch for a few months now ( it's still nothing special ). I'm aiming to ship this project recording progress and lessons learned here. The first progress update will be coming soon.
